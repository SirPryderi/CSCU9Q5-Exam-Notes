# The Relational Model
The relational model was proposed by the mathematician Edward Codd in 1970.
This model has a strong theoretical and mathematical foundation to back its functioning.

## Terminology
- **Relation** ─ A two-dimensional table. AKA File.
- **Row** ─ An individual row of the table. AKA Record, Tuple.
- **Attribute** ─ A named column of a relation. AKA Field.
- **Cardinality** ─ Number of rows.
- **Degree** ─ Number of columns.
- **Domain** ─ A set of allowed values of a specific attribute.

## Properties of Relation
- The name of the relation is unique.
- The names of an attribute in unique only within its relation.
- The values of an attribute are all from the same domain.
- The order of attributes within a relation has no significance.
- The order of rows within a relation has no significance.
- The records within a relation should all be distinct.
- Each cell of a relation should contain at most _one value_.

## Keys
Keys are attributes used to uniquely identify one a row.

### Superkeys
A **superkey** is any attribute (or set of attributes) that uniquely identifies a row.

### Candidate Keys
A **candidate key** is a minimal _super key_, i.e. does not have any superfluous attribute.
More specifically, A _superkey_ is minimal if removing any attributes would mean that it no
longer provides unique identification.

A table often has more than one candidate key.

A candidate key has the following properties:
- **Uniqueness** ─ No two rows of the table can have the same value of the candidate key.
- **Irreducibility** ─ No subset of the candidate key has the _uniqueness_ property.

### Primary Key
A **primary key** is a candidate key that has been chosen to be the default way of identifying a row.
If there is no natural attribute suitable as primary key, a **surrogate key** can be generated.

### Foreign Key
A foreign key is an attribute (or set of attributes) in one table,
that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table.

## Relational Database Schema
To represent the conceptual schema for a relational database,
the following notation can be used to describe a table:

  ```
  relational_name(_attribute1_, attribute2, ..., attributeN)
  ```

Note: those underscores are an attempt at showing an underline, to identify the primary key.

## Nulls
`null` is a value that can be assigned to a cell to specify that its content has not been assigned.
This differs significantly to setting it to `0` or `""` (empty string).

## Entity Rules
### Entity Integrity Rule
In a relation, no attribute of a primary key can be `null`.

### Referential Integrity Rule
If a relation contains a foreign key, either the foreign key value must
match the value of a primary key of a record in the home relation,
or the foreign key must be `null`.

Now for humans, and other semi-intelligent species: no foreign key referencing to something that is not there.

# Entity Relationship Modelling
# SQL
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a declarative language for manipulating a relational database.
- **MySQL** is a particular dialect of the SQL language.

## SQL Syntax
Although not mandatory, it is good practice to write reserved words UPPERCASE in SQL, and wrap database elements name between backwards quotes (\`).

Example of fussily written SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT `morty_id` FROM `standard_finite_curve_table` WHERE `id` = 'C-173';
```

### SQL Data Types
Some of the most used data types in SQL.

| Type            | Description                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------|
| VARCHAR         | String of variable length    |
| INT             | Integer numbers              |
| DECIMAL         | Numbers with decimal places  |
| DATE            | A full date                  |
| TEXT            | A long string of text        |
| BOOLEAN         | Single binary value          |

### Create Table
The following syntax can be used to create a new table in the database.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE `Staff` (
  `id`          INT,
  `name`        VARCHAR(20),
  `length`      INT,
  `damage`      FLOAT,
  `wooden`      BOOLEAN
);
```

### Alter Table
The following syntax can be used to edit the structure of a table
already in the database.

```SQL
  ALTER TABLE `Staff` ADD (
    `has_nails` BOOLEAN
  );

  ALTER TABLE `Staff` MODIFY (
    `length` FLOAT
  );
```

### Drop a table
**Dropping** a table means deleting its data and structure. You have been warned.

```SQL
DROP TABLE tablename;
```

### Truncate a table
**Truncating** a table means deleting its data only. You have been warned anyway.

```SQL
TRUNCATE TABLE tablename;
```

### Insert in a table
INSERT can be used to populate the table with some data.

This syntax follows the order of the attributes.
```SQL
INSERT INTO `Staff` VALUES (
    1,
    "Mighty Fire Staff",
    2,
    50.4
)
```

### Updating a table
Tables can be updated with the following syntax.

```SQL
UPDATE `Staff` SET `name`="My Mighty Fire Staff" WHERE `id` = 1;
```

### Joins
When selecting you can join the result from two or more tables using a JOIN.

```SQL
SELECT Staff.name Element.name FROM Staff
  INNER JOIN Element ON Staff.element_id = Element.id;

```

### Groups
Yeah, you can group stuff. I can't teach you everything, read a book or something.
